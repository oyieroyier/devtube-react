- [YouTube API](https://developers.google.com/youtube/v3)
- [Piston API](https://piston.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api-v2/)

- [Monaco React Editor](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@monaco-editor/react)
- [Axios](https://axios-http.com/docs/intro), and
- [Mantine](https://mantine.dev/) component library.

**NB:Feel free to fork this repo and play around with it. :)**
